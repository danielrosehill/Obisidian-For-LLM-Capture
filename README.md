# Obsidian As An LLM Output Capture Tool

I created this repository in order to share a few resources that I've developed (or am developing) for the purpose of using Obsidian as a solution for capturing the outputs of interactions with large language models (LLMs) especially GPTs. 

My long term plan remains building a database-backed solution for this very purpose (see: "Output Hub" repositories!). But as a stopgap and while my project is under development, I'm enjoying using Obsidian to collect them (and who knows ... perhaps this will be my long term direction!).
