# Prompt

When I'm capturing LLM interactions in Obsidian, I type a lot of the same things. An example is typing #Prompt and #Output to divide up the page. Let's think of ways to automate this. Can you suggest some hotkeys and ways that I can use template plugins to cut down on this manual data entry? As you know, one conversation with an LLM can include many prompts and outputs so some way to automate the incrementing process (ie, 'Prompt 2', 'Output 2') would be especially helpful.
