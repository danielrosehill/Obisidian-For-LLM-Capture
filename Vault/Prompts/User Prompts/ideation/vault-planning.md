# Prompt

## My LLM Obsidian Vault

I am using an Obsidian vault in order to create a repository of information that retains the work that I do with GPTs and LLMs.

My repository is structured to contain three main folders:

- Prompts
- Outputs
- Agents

Prompts records the prompts that I use.
Outputs records the outputs that I receive from those prompts after I run them through LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude.
Agents records the configuration parameters for custom LLM agents that I create. 

Please generate suggestions on how I can structure this Obsidian vault to make this as useful as possible for its intended purposes of providing a comprehensive repository of information recording my use of LLMs.

The repository is intended to allow me to keep the information that I generate from LLM runs organised and in one place. It also allows me to create a workspace for editing those outputs later - to fix inaccuracies, for example, or to add my notes. 

With all this context in mind, please suggest 20 functionalities I could implement in order to make this repository as useful as purpose.
