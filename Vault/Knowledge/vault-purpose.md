I am using an Obsidian vault in order to create a repository of information that retains the work that I do with GPTs and LLMs.

My repository is structured to contain three main folders:

- Prompts
- Outputs
- Agents

Prompts records the prompts that I use.
Outputs records the outputs that I receive from those prompts after I run them through LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude.
Agents records the configuration parameters for custom LLM agents that I create.
