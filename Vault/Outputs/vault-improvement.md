# Prompt

I am using an Obsidian vault in order to create a repository of information that retains the work that I do with GPTs and LLMs.

My repository is structured to contain three main folders:

- Prompts
- Outputs
- Agents

Prompts records the prompts that I use.
Outputs records the outputs that I receive from those prompts after I run them through LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude.
Agents records the configuration parameters for custom LLM agents that I create. 

Please generate suggestions on how I can structure this Obsidian vault to make this as useful as possible for its intended purposes of providing a comprehensive repository of information recording my use of LLMs.

The repository is intended to allow me to keep the information that I generate from LLM runs organised and in one place. It also allows me to create a workspace for editing those outputs later - to fix inaccuracies, for example, or to add my notes. 

With all this context in mind, please suggest 20 functionalities I could implement in order to make this repository as useful as purpose. 

# Output

Based on your description of your Obsidian vault for managing LLM-related work, here are 20 functionalities you could implement to enhance its usefulness:

1. **Tagging System**: Implement a comprehensive tagging system to categorize prompts, outputs, and agents by topic, project, or use case[1].

2. **Cross-linking**: Utilize Obsidian's linking capabilities to create connections between related prompts, outputs, and agents[1].

3. **Template Notes**: Create template notes for prompts, outputs, and agent configurations to ensure consistency in your documentation[1].

4. **Dataview Integration**: Use the Dataview plugin to create dynamic lists and tables of your prompts, outputs, and agents based on metadata[1][3].

5. **Version Control**: Implement a version control system for prompts and agents, possibly using the Git plugin for Obsidian[3].

6. **Prompt Library**: Develop a searchable prompt library with categorization and metadata for easy retrieval[1].

7. **Output Analysis Dashboard**: Create a dashboard note that aggregates and analyzes the effectiveness of different prompts and agents[4].

8. **Kanban Board**: Use the Kanban plugin to manage the workflow of prompt creation, testing, and refinement[3].

9. **Automated Backlinks**: Set up a system to automatically create backlinks between prompts and their corresponding outputs[1].

10. **LLM Performance Tracking**: Implement a system to track and compare the performance of different LLMs for specific tasks[4].

11. **Prompt Engineering Notes**: Create a section for prompt engineering techniques and best practices, linked to relevant examples in your vault[1].

12. **Agent Comparison Charts**: Develop comparison charts for different agent configurations using Obsidian's table or chart plugins[4].

13. **Output Revision History**: Maintain a revision history for outputs that you edit or refine over time[3].

14. **Task Management**: Integrate task management for LLM-related projects using Obsidian's task plugins[3].

15. **Inspiration Gallery**: Create an inspiration gallery of creative or particularly effective prompts and outputs[1].

16. **Metadata Schema**: Develop a consistent metadata schema for all notes to facilitate organization and querying[1][3].

17. **Integration with External Tools**: Set up methods to easily import/export data between your Obsidian vault and external LLM tools or APIs[3].

18. **Collaborative Features**: If working with a team, implement collaborative features like shared vaults or commenting systems[3].

19. **Automated Report Generation**: Create templates and scripts to generate summary reports of your LLM work periodically[4].

20. **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Utilize Obsidian's graph view to visualize the connections between different elements of your LLM work, enhancing your understanding of the relationships within your vault[1][4].

These functionalities should help you create a comprehensive and efficient system for managing your LLM-related work within Obsidian. Remember to adapt and refine these suggestions based on your specific workflow and needs.

# Input

Great. Let me pick up on a few of those ideas so that we can explore them further.

## The version control suggestion

I like the idea of version control (5). But I'd rather retain unique files for each version rather than version prompts through Git.

Let's say that I'm working on iteratively improving an important prompt. Perhaps it's the prompt that I used to start this conversation. 

Can you suggest a folder structure that I can use for version control purposes in my repository?

## Prompt engineering resources

I liked your idea to create a section of resources. You mentioned prompt engineering but I think it would be more useful to have general resources for using LLMs effectively. This could include prompt engineering techniques but it could be a bit broader. 

Can you think of discrete categories of resources that I may wish to include?

# Output 2

Certainly! I'll address both the version control suggestion and the prompt engineering resources idea in more detail.

## Version Control Folder Structure

For version control of prompts without using Git, you could implement the following folder structure:

```
Prompts/
├── Active/
│   ├── Prompt_A/
│   │   ├── Prompt_A_v1.md
│   │   ├── Prompt_A_v2.md
│   │   └── Prompt_A_current.md
│   └── Prompt_B/
│       ├── Prompt_B_v1.md
│       └── Prompt_B_current.md
├── Archived/
│   └── Old_Prompt_C/
│       ├── Old_Prompt_C_v1.md
│       ├── Old_Prompt_C_v2.md
│       └── Old_Prompt_C_final.md
└── Templates/
    └── Prompt_Template.md
```

This structure offers several benefits:

1. Each prompt has its own folder, allowing for easy organization of related files.
2. Versions are clearly labeled (v1, v2, etc.).
3. The "current" version is always easily identifiable.
4. Archived prompts are kept separate but still accessible.
5. A templates folder can store standardized formats for new prompts.

You could also include a "changelog.md" file in each prompt folder to track changes between versions.

## LLM Resource Categories

For a broader section on LLM resources, you could consider the following categories:

1. **Prompt Engineering Techniques**
   - Basic principles
   - Advanced strategies
   - Domain-specific techniques

2. **LLM Model Comparisons**
   - Capabilities and limitations of different models
   - Benchmarks and performance metrics

3. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Bias in LLMs
   - Privacy concerns
   - Responsible AI usage

4. **Integration and APIs**
   - How to integrate LLMs into applications
   - API documentation and best practices

5. **Fine-tuning and Transfer Learning**
   - Techniques for customizing LLMs
   - Dataset preparation for fine-tuning

6. **Output Interpretation**
   - Understanding LLM outputs
   - Dealing with hallucinations and inaccuracies

7. **Use Case Studies**
   - Real-world applications of LLMs
   - Success stories and lessons learned

8. **LLM Security**
   - Potential vulnerabilities
   - Best practices for secure LLM usage

9. **Performance Optimization**
   - Techniques for improving response time and quality
   - Resource management for LLM applications

10. **Future Trends and Research**
    - Emerging technologies in the LLM field
    - Academic papers and cutting-edge research

11. **Community Resources**
    - Forums, discussion groups, and online communities
    - Conferences and events related to LLMs

12. **Troubleshooting and FAQs**
    - Common issues and their solutions
    - Tips for debugging LLM-related problems

These categories should provide a comprehensive overview of resources for effectively using LLMs, going beyond just prompt engineering to cover a wide range of relevant topics. You can adjust and expand these categories based on your specific interests and needs.
