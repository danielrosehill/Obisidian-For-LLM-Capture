# Prompt

Is there a way to take an "imprint" of the structure of my Github vault that would copy the folder structure without containing any of the internal files and which I could use to compress into an archive intended to serve as a template?

# Output

Yes, there are several ways to create a template or "imprint" of your GitHub repository's folder structure without including the actual files. Here's a method you can use:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Use the `find` command to create empty files that represent the structure:
   ```
   find . -type d -exec mkdir -p "../repo-structure/{}" \;
   find . -type f -exec touch "../repo-structure/{}" \;
   ```

3. Remove the .git directory from the new structure:
   ```
   rm -rf ../repo-structure/.git
   ```

4. Create an archive of the structure:
   ```
   cd ..
   zip -r repo-structure.zip repo-structure
   ```

This process will create a zip file named `repo-structure.zip` that contains the folder structure of your repository with empty files representing the original files.

Alternatively, you can use a Git command to list the structure:

```
git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD > repo-structure.txt
```

This command will create a text file listing all files and directories in your repository.

To recreate the structure from this list:

1. Create a new directory:
   ```
   mkdir repo-structure
   cd repo-structure
   ```

2. Use a script to recreate the structure:
   ```bash
   while IFS= read -r file; do
     mkdir -p "$(dirname "$file")"
     touch "$file"
   done < ../repo-structure.txt
   ```

3. Compress the structure:
   ```
   cd ..
   zip -r repo-structure.zip repo-structure
   ```

These methods allow you to create a template of your repository structure that you can easily share or use as a starting point for new projects.
