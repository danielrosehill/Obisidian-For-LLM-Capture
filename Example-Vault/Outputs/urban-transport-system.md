# Prompt

Design a sustainable urban transportation system for a city of 5 million people, considering environmental impact, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.

# Output

A sustainable urban transportation system for a city of 5 million people should integrate multiple modes of transport to maximize efficiency and minimize environmental impact. The system could include:

## Public Transit
- **Extensive metro network**: Cover major residential and commercial areas
- **Electric bus fleet**: For areas not served by metro
- **Tram system**: For medium-capacity routes

## Active Transportation
- **Dedicated bike lanes**: Citywide network of protected cycling paths
- **Pedestrian-friendly zones**: Car-free areas in city center and neighborhoods

## Shared Mobility
- **Bike and e-scooter sharing**: For last-mile connectivity
- **Car-sharing services**: Electric vehicles for occasional use

## Smart Infrastructure
- **Intelligent traffic management**: Real-time adjustments to traffic flow
- **Integrated payment system**: Single card or app for all transport modes

## Incentives and Policies
- **Congestion pricing**: Discourage private car use in peak hours
- **Subsidies for green transport**: Make sustainable options more affordable

This system prioritizes public and active transport, reducing reliance on private vehicles. It addresses environmental concerns by favoring electric and human-powered modes. Accessibility is improved through comprehensive coverage and integrated payment systems. Cost-effectiveness is achieved through efficient use of resources and reduced infrastructure needs for private vehicles.
